# **What is DevOps** 

The term “DevOps” was coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, who would later become one of the gurus of the time. This term is a portmanteau of the words "Development" and "Operations" and provides a starting point for understanding exactly what people mean when they say "DevOps." It's important to remember that DevOps is not a process, technology, or standard. DevOps was birthed by the practice and propagation of agile software development. Since the agile methodology speeds up the development process and throughput velocity, there was a need to alter the structure of project teams to accommodate this new reality. As agile culture took root, it became clear that having the software development and IT operations teams working separately was counterproductive and inefficient.
DevOps is adopted and applied in different ways from organization to organization. Nevertheless, certain capabilities are common in nearly all DevOps implementations. The key characteristics adopted by DevOps are Collaboration, Automation, Continuous integration, Continuous testing, Continuous delivery, Continuous monitoring.
Developers and system administrators may not always agree on many things, but they agree that the consumer side of the business often pulls them in different directions. On the one hand, business users want change as quickly as possible; new features, new services, new revenue streams. They also want the system to be stable and free from interference and attacks. This creates a dilemma where companies feel they have to choose between delivering rapid change and dealing with an unstable production environment or maintaining a stable but stale environment. Developers are increasingly interested in delivering faster software; after all, that's usually what they're hired for. Operators, on the other hand, know that rapid changes without proper protection can directly violate their rights by weakening the body. DevOps was created to solve this problem by integrating everyone involved in software development and deployment. -Business users, developers, engineers, security professionals, project managers, and sometimes others enter with a focus on advanced business tasks: quickly deliver quality software that meets the needs of all users while maintaining system-wide software integrity and stability.
Organizations that adopt DevOps can have all IT resources in traditional data centers, all services in the external cloud, or have their resources distributed in a hybrid environment. The DevOps movement is not defined or driven by traditional IT software, hardware or management vendors. Additionally, there are currently no written rules or guidelines for DevOps; There are only accepted guidelines. However, DevOps adoption and implementation varies from organization to organization. DevOps training is typically offered by a dedicated community of IT professionals across various IT disciplines. Most members of the DevOps community hold active positions in various organizations and share their knowledge in various online forums, in person, and at meetings. Depending on the number and size of developers in your organization, implementing DevOps can have significant benefits, such as: Deploy applications faster through a combination of design, testing, and deployment processes, Many developers develop. Operational efficiency by managing the process according to the rules, Improving customer service through timely feedback and continuous improvement.

# **SDLC**

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that produces high-quality, low-cost software in the shortest possible time. SDLC's goal is to create quality software that meets and exceeds all customer needs and desires.

## Why is SDLC Important
- It provides a standard structure for identifying tasks and deliverables.
- Helps plan, estimate and schedule work.
- Re-facilitates project tracking and management.
- Improves all aspects of the lifecycle for all stakeholders Involved in the development process.
- Increases development speed.
- Improves customer relations.
- Reduces project risk.
- Reduces management burden and total production cost.

An application lifecycle management system is important because it helps developers create a quality software product and provides a foundation for all project work. When following the SDLC approach, all project stakeholders can see the project from start to finish. It also helps developers manage their time and resources better and provides easy project tracking. The phases in SDLC are:
**Planning**: This typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning. 
**Analysis**: It's a further planning phase, The development team collects input from stakeholders involved in the project; customers, sales, internal and external experts, and developers. This input is synthesized into a detailed definition of the requirements for creating the desired software. The team also determines what resources are required to satisfy the project requirements, and then infers the associated cost.
**Design**: This phase involves transforming the software requirements gathered during the Requirements Analysis phase into a structured design document.
**Implementation**: In this phase, the system is installed to support the intended business functions. System performance is compared to performance objectives established during the planning phase.
**Testing**: The testing is done to ensure that the entire application works according to the customer requirements. After testing, the QA and testing team might find some bugs or defects and communicate the same with the developers
**Deployment**: The deployment phase is the final step in the software development life cycle and delivers the final product to the customer in a live production environment. After the product deploys, the product is ready for customers to use.
**Maintenance**: The maintenance phase of the SDLC occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys.

	There are many ways to implement SDLC into your project. The most common models are:
**Waterfall**
Waterfall represents the oldest, simplest and most common technique. Each phase depends on the results of the previous phase, and each phase is executed sequentially. The model provides discipline and gives clear results at the end of each stage. However, this model is not suitable when changes need to be made. Once a phase is decided, there is little room for change that will affect the cost, delivery time and quality of the software.

**Agile**
Agile method of continuous development; Each version contains minor, incremental changes over the previous version. In each iteration, elements are tested. The agile team model detects and solves small problems in the project before they turn into larger problems. The team can also communicate with partners and get their feedback throughout the development process.

**Lean**
The Lean approach to software development is inspired by lean manufacturing practices and principles. Lean principles encourage the creation of better business processes and the creation of a culture of continuous improvement. The seven lean principles are:
- Eliminate waste.
- Improve learning.
- Make decisions as late as possible.
- Deliver as soon as possible.
- Support team.
- Build internal integrity.
- Total development.

**Iteration**
In the iterative process, each development cycle will create an incomplete but deployable version of the software. The first iteration used minimal software requirements, and additional requirements were added with each iteration. The last iteration has the full set.

**Spiral**
In the spiral design model, the development process is guided by the project's risk model. The development team reviews the project and decides which elements will be integrated with other process models.

**V-Shape**
In the V-shaped model, proof time and proof time run in parallel. Each valid period is associated with a validation phase, and the model works in a V-shape where each development phase has an associated testing phase.

	The DevOps methodology is a relative newcomer to the SDLC scene. It emerged from two trends: the application of Agile and Lean practices to operations work and the general shift in business toward seeing the value of collaboration between development and operations staff at all stages of the SDLC process.
Here are some issues that may negatively impact your SDLC implementation. Perhaps the most common mistake is not taking into account and meeting the needs of customers and stakeholders in the process. This leads to a misunderstanding of the body's needs and the disappointment that doesn't come with the end product.
Additionally, the complexity of SDLC often results in the project being lost or the team losing track of the content and requirements. If measurement is not possible and all aspects of the design are not tightly followed, the project may fall short of its goals.
Despite the challenges, the benefits of implementing DevOps in SDLC are clear. Organizations that have successfully implemented DevOps have reported improved deployment frequency, faster time to market, lower failure rate of new releases, shortened lead time between fixes, and faster mean time to recovery. DevOps best practices for continuous integration and deployment in SDLC can bring significant benefits to organizations. These practices can help teams deliver software faster and with better quality, by automating processes, reducing manual work, and increasing efficiency.
